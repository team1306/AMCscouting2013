AMCscouting2013
===============

This is a copy of the active AMC folder for our 2013 scouting system. We don't sync some of the LaTeX support files, but do sync pretty much everything else.

Our scouting sheet design is based on two goals:

1. Collect the data necessary to rank our robot. (This includes intentionally omitting data that we don't need.)
2. Make scouting as easy on our scouts as possible.

To this end, we build the scouting sheets so that the scouts don't need to do any math, just count, as well as giving them a dedicated space to make tally marks or other notes. If we had a larger scouting team, we would pre-fill the team and round numbers for the scouts.

We may implement a checkbox which signifies the robot did not function during the match so that there is no requirement to fill in many zeroes.
